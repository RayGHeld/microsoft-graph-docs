# educationUser resource type

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A user in the system. This is an education-specific variant of the user with the same `id` that Microsoft Graph will return from the non-education-specific `/users` endpoint.
This object provides a targeted subset of properties from the core [user] object and adds a set of education-specific properties such as `primaryRole`, student, and teacher data.
